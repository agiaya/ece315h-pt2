TSNE --> State of the art of dimensional decomposition

Linear Regression: or Sparse linear regression 

Methods
lasso
basis pursuit
matching pursuit

group sparse linear regression where each emotion uses different coefficients

12/5 Notes:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sparse LinReg: 
Use the weights from sparse linear regression to determine which columns to use  

Neural Network:
solvmax(w)i --> e^-wi / sum(e^-wi)
sigmoid
corentropy
euclidean

Look up classification/estimation/regression ML problems to find what to use instead of corentropy, corentropy is only for binary

data: as many as you need for training, rest of testing, small sliver for validation

For Valence/Arousal Values:
try neural network
something simple like SVM (support vector machines) or nearest neighbors could work

trained the same way, Train, Test, Validate
